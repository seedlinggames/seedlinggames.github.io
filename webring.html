<p>Here are some cool people with cool personal websites.
They are mostly TTRPG-adjacent, though many of them cover a range of topics.
That's the cool thing about personal websites: much less pressure to make some large corporation's algorithm
happy, so you can have some fun with it.</p>

<p>If you want to be added, let me know. At some point I'll also put together and link some resources for making your own personal website.</p>
<p>Also, not a blog, but for more non-corporate internet content, come hang out in the #ittrpg channel <a href="https://webchat.esper.net/#chan-2">here</a>.
  It's more chill than discord, so you might need to idle for a while before people start talking.</p>

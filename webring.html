<p>Here are some cool people with cool personal websites.
They are mostly TTRPG-adjacent, though many of them cover a range of topics.
That's the cool thing about personal websites: much less pressure to make some large corporation's algorithm
happy, so you can have some fun with it.</p>

<p>If you want to be added, let me know. At some point I'll also put together and link some resources for making your own personal website.</p>
<p>Also, not a blog, but for more non-corporate internet content, come hang out in the #ittrpg channel <a href="https://webchat.esper.net/#chan-2">here</a>.
  It's more chill than discord, so you might need to idle for a while before people start talking.</p>

  <p class="title">SOUP</p>
  An informal group of independent focused TTRPG creators working together to support each other. There are more of us and maybe eventually we'll have something more organized to cross-support our work.

  We've got a general interest in a DIY attitude (maybe?), solo games (though not exclusively), low pressure collaboration, helping each other learn, still figuring out what we are. But all cool people whose games you should check out.

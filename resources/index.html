<h2 class="title">Help!  I want to make a game but art is expensive!</h2>
<p> There are three main approaches. First, you can commission art and maps. This is generally expensive. I've written <a href="numbers_sept.html">here</a> about the economics of your first product. You can also try to make your own.</p>

<p>You can also use public domain art. There is a lot online but it can be hard to search. Finally, you can buy stock art.  There are a lot of sites for free stock art photos, but usually they aren't fantasy themed. On DriveThruRpg and DM's Guild, you can for a relatively small price buy stock art. Make sure you read the license, though! </p>

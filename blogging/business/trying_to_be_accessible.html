Not one thing, it's a spectrum of trying to be more inclusive
Screen readers are a minimum I try to aim for
Some formats inherently not acessible e.g. physical books are not accessible visually and in some cases financially + internationally.
Does this mean books are bad? No, but consider making other options.

Perfect is the enemy of good. Best to try and keep trying than be overwhelmed.

I don't have a relevant disability and it's best to follow the lead of those who do, as everyone is the expert on their own experiences.
As smeone marginalized in other ways, aggressively attacking people on behalf of a group you do not belong to isn't always helpful, and I wish people would
take the lead of people more directly affected.

Gold standard: one good screen-readable PDF that also does cool layout. D36 for instance. Indie ttrpgs really leading the way.

Challenge 1: How to make?

Easiest: a text document with all visual elements described. E.g. twitter alt text (recommend doing this!)

PDFs. Good: you can do certain things to make them a lot easier + faster for screen reader users to use.
You can have something that looks cool and is accessible in one product, though the coolness is proportional to your skill at doing so and it's not an easy skill.
Cons: the tools for doing so are often paid. Can be bloated and error prone. Complex projects might require hiring an expert.

Text:
Pros: Absolutely free, works with screen readers, people with dyslexia etc can set their own fonts.
Cons: Can't do screen reader friendly tables or other more complex formatting, including using headings for easier navigation.

Markdown: like text documents but nicer, I think you can use headings and so on for navigation.

HTML: actually has the same pitfalls as PDFs if you do anything fancy, but usually lighter weight.

I use Word, but that is paid and some people don't use microsoft products on ethical grounds.
There is a feature to review for accesibility and it will walk you through it. 
Other things to keep in mind is to use headings in a logical way.
Adobe products also do, but they are espensive.
Unfortunately free options or even lower cost opltions like affinity have not prioritized accesibility.
If using these products would be a financial barrier (or an ethical one), fortunately there are other optins.

html
epub
Markdown
And there is always plain, unformatted text.

Aspect ratio: make phone friendly

Are images bad? No, can be accessible in other ways.
E.g:
- Helpful for people with disabilities related to reading large amounts of text, e.g. ADHD, dyslexia
- Helpful for people who are less fluent in English, to provide non language based context
- Many people find grpahical content easier to learn and understand even without a disability or with an undiagnosed disability
- Art is wortwhile even if it isn't accessible to everyone.

However, obviously not accessible to everyone!

Thinking about accessibility is a great framework for revision. It can take some time, but makes things better.
Makes you think critically about what information visual elements are conveying. By describing them in words, you can be deliberate
about how you are doing them. Are they having the right effect? I've definitely made my work better after an accessibility pass.

My approach: An image-heavy approach that looks cool and is easy to digest for visually oriented people
and a separate all-text doc with headings etc.


You can totally test screenreaders on your own and I recommend it.

Other forms of accesibility include community copie

Twitter alt text
A great way to practice.
For images you are likely to post agian, save the text somewhere.

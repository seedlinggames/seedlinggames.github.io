<h2 class="title">Help!  I want to make a game but art is expensive!</h2>
<p> There are three main approaches. First, you can commission art and maps. This is generally expensive. I've written <a href=numbers_sept.html">here</a> about the economics of your first product.</p>

<p> You can also try to make your own.  For maps,  Dungeondraft and Inkarnate are good choices, although if making maps doesn't sound fun, maps are usually cheap (see below).</p>

<p> You can also use public domain art.  The British Library's flikr account is one good place.  There is a lot online but it can be hard to search.  I've been trying to organize some rpg relevant art into <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/sanaerosen/open-content-for-rpgs/">this Pinterest board.</a>


<h3 class="subtitle">Recommendations from the RPG Writer's Workshop</h3>
<p>Finally, you can buy stock art.  There are a lot of sites for free stock art photos, but usually they aren't fantasy themed. On DriveThruRpg and DM's Guild, you can for a relatively small price buy stock art.Make sure you read the license, though!</p>

<p>If you're looking for something specific on the page, try searching with control F.  This is probably quickly going to become out of date, but you can always follow the links.</p>

<h4 class="subsubtitle">My maps</h4>

<p>First, this is my website so I can be biased and list my stuff, which is maps. So far they are all in the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/333051/Seedling-Games-Map-Megapack-1--City-Town-and-Forest-BUNDLE">bundle</a>, or click on the bundle link to buy them in smaller sets.</p>

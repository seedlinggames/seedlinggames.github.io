<h2 class="title">Help!  I want to make a game but art is expensive!</h2>
<p> There are three main approaches. First, you can commission art and maps. This is generally expensive. I've written <a href="numbers_sept.html">here</a> about the economics of your first product. You can also try to make your own.  For maps,  Dungeondraft and Inkarnate are good choices, although if making maps doesn't sound fun, maps are usually cheap (see below).</p>

<p>You can also use public domain art. There is a lot online but it can be hard to search. Finally, you can buy stock art.  There are a lot of sites for free stock art photos, but usually they aren't fantasy themed. On DriveThruRpg and DM's Guild, you can for a relatively small price buy stock art. Make sure you read the license, though! </p>

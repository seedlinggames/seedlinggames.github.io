<h2 class="title">Mythic ASIs: A framework for building characters in fantasy adventure games</h2>


<p>A lot has been written about issues surrounding race in D&D and similar RPGs, and I'm assuming you're familiar with them and on board with changing them. If not, this blog post probably isn't very relevant to you.</p>

<p>Building characters is something a lot of people enjoy. It's fun to make mechanically significant decisions about what kind of character you're playing, and have it affect both your character's story and how they play mechanically. Now in modern fantasy, based on Tolkien, there's this idea that there are distinct humanoid races, but this is a fairly modern idea. In the past in folklore you got powers from gods, or devils, or the strange otherworldly demigods in the land of the elves, or you just happened to be unusually strong or something. So I thought, what if we drew more from that sort of fantasy? </p>

<h2 class="subtitle">The overall concept</h2>

<p><b>All of this is a proof of concept only. It is not meant to be balanced or even playable.</b> </p>

<p>The way you make a character is, you have +2 to a mental stat and +2 to a physical stat, a major power and a minor power (or maybe multiple minor powers).  Some major powers and minor powers are open to everyone, and some are packaged together with a fixed mental or physical stat. </p>

<p>Let's first consider <b>physical stats</b>. Some characters are big and brawny, and others are small and nimble, but do the former have to be orcs and the latter have to be halflings? Even in a world with just humans those archetypes would not be out of place. So why not separate physique from race? You can choose some appropriate collection of physical traits, and even mix and match them, and then describe what kind of person your character is independently.</p>

<p><b>Mental stats</b> is where I decided to incorporate myth more. What if being a tiefling wasn't something you were born with, but something that you chose, or something that happens if you spend too much time in contact with fiendish forces? What if the difference between a high elf and a wood elf wasn't something you were born with, but is what happened if you spent most of your life in the Feywild? And there are many stories of humans being lost for many years among the fey and gaining strange powers.  So mental stats are supernatural in origin, and associated with supernatural powers. And they can even change in pivotal moments in the game. But if you decide to omit these from the game altogether, your characters are no less powerful.</p>

<p><b>Cultures</b> cover things like proficiencies only. I have thoughts I'll elaborate on more, but basically some cultures might be more familiar with some weapons than others, for instance, but I have mixed feelings about associating stats with cultures.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">The default character</h2>
<p>By default you have: +2 any, +2 any, and a major power something like "once per day, when rolling a saving throw, including a death saving throw, you treat it as a natural 20". The default minor ability is 'advantage against being frightened'.</p>

 <p>This represents that you don't seem exceptional, but somehow when it matters you come through, it's sort of meant to play into the unlikely hero archetype. Now traditionally this is something that would be for humans, but if you think of say Lord of the Rings, Frodo is the best fit for this type of character.</p>

<p>You can swap out any of the powers if appropriate in game, but some powers have a prerequesite in terms of what one of your stats might be.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">Physical forms</h2>

<p>These are more or less fixed, although I think it would be cool if they can change. Like maybe spend a bunch of time figuring out how to make mechanical wings and you can fly.</p>

<p><b>Brawny:</b> Your +2 in a physical stat is in strength. You may also pick the following major ability: Basically the half-orc's ability on a crit. For your minor ability you gain advantage on Intimidate checks and Athletics checks or something like that.  This is pretty similar to the half-orc but doesn't have to be the half-orc.</p>

<p><b>Nimble:</b> Your +2 to a physical stat must be in dex. Major ability: You take half falling damage, gain a climb speed of 20', and a run speed of 30'. Minor ability: you gain advantage on acrobatics checks and when using thieves' tools.</p>

<p><b>Rugged</b> Your +2 to a physical stat must be in con. Major ability: you gain an extra hit point per level, and also resist poison, acid, cold and fire.  Minor ability: your speed is not reduced when wearing heavy armour.</p>

<p><b>Machine</b> This could maybe just be a variant on rugged?</p>

<p><b>Flying</b> Major ability: You gain a fly speed of 30 ft. I might have a supernatural version of this too.</p>

<p><b>Misc minor abilities</b>
<ul>
  <li>Extra arms or tail: Once per round, you can take a bonus action as a free action that involves manipulating a physical object, such as opening a door.
</li>
<li>Claws or fangs: You gain a melee weapon that does 1d6 damage. You cannot be disarmed.

</li>
<li> Subterranean: You gain darkvision.
</li>
<li>Sleepless: You don't need to sleep, though you do need to rest, and magic can't put you to sleep.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">Supernatural traits</h2>

<p>Gaining or losing a trait isn't trivial, and is something you should coordinate with the DM on, but would be a great thing to include in a long-running campaign. When you switch mid game, you change your stats, and may optionally swap out your major or minor ability to something you are still eligible for.</p>

<p><b>Fey-Touched</b> After spending decades in secret places out of the normal flow of time, you have knowledge beyond that of ordinary mortals. Your mental stat is fixed as +2 Int. Major abilitiy: Some thematically appropriate spell(s). Minor ability: resistance to charmed?</p>

<p><b>Angelic or Fiendish</b> Whether due to an ill-advised deal, an (un)holy gift, or some other connection to the realms above or below, you have a strangely compelling angelic and/or fiendish mien and possibly the powers to match. Your +2 to a mental stat is fixed as Cha. Major ability: Also thematically appropriate spell(s). Minor ability: radiant or fire resistance or something?</p>

<p><b>Therianthrope</b> You can change into an animal. Maybe you're an animal that became human, or a human that became animal, but you have the instincts and senses of an animal with a +2 Wis. Powers: I feel like there should be a few options, e.g. seal form, swan form, lycanthrope form, where you gain swimming, flying and a new attack, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Draconic</b> You might be descended from dragons, or ate the heart of a dragon, or were "cursed" for being greedy or something. You have a +2 Cha with a dragon's hypnotic gaze. Major ability: breath weapon of course. Minor ability: associated resistance</p>

<h2 class="subtitle"> What does this imply?</h2>
<p>First of all, character traits are not fixed, and can change over time, which can give some interesting stories. Pinnochio becomes a real boy. The swan maiden gives up her wings to live among humans.</p>

<p>It also means that, as long as everyone at the table agrees that it sets the right tone for the game you all want to play, you can be a lot more flexible in the character you play. Your dragonborn character might fight with the strength of a dragon, or might fly around setting things on fire. Your tiefling could have a usable tail, or be able to head-butt people with horns. Your human could have been kidnapped by the fey and have strange and magical powers as a result. You could play a giant butterfly with 4 arms even though it's not written down anywhere.</p>

<p>If the table wants a lower power game, you can restrict it to physical templates only. If you want a higher power game, you could allow two major powers (or minor powers, or whatever). If you want a human only game, you can still have a decent list of character options. And being able to combine things gives a lot more options.</p>

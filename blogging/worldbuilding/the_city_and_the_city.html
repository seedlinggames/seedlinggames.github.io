I like to keep what I think of as my real life separate from my TTRPG life, for a bunch of reasons, and that's why I write under a pseudonym, but at the same time my TTRPG writing necessarily reflects my real life.

I've tried to write something cyberpunk several times. I should be good at it, because I live in one of the most cyberpunk places you can live. I have a lot of opinions on what other people's cyberpunk gets wrong, but I can't get it right. It hits too close to home. I realized I couldn't play CYBORG when I started thinking about what we call each of those districts here.

It's also a city of immigrants and there is nothing quite like immigrating to get into the cyberpunk mindset. Maybe the thing I liked the most in this genre is Working For The Corp. Because you probably would. Even if on the weekends and in the evenings you go out and mess with the corps, you still need to pay rent for your tiny, crumbling apartment. Part of the power fantasy of cyberpunk is that no matter how oppressive The System is, you can escape, you aren't the one trapped in capitalism. Most people don't get to be the heroes, you end up being the NPCs. As I write this I am reading this through the eyes of the government. I have lived a pretty boring life, but will someone infer something between the lines that isn't there? I've thought about making an RPG that is entirely based on the form you fill out to get your green card. People think of immigration as being this kind of noble thing, or they hate it, but for most people the truth lies somewhere in between: you came here for money and you had to sell some parts of yourself to get it. Not the biggest part. Sometimes I think that stories about the fey and their contracts are just about the modern legal system.

So that's the city. I see cars that drive themselves going past posters that advertise some AI thing to upload everyone's iris in the world to the blockchain. Sometimes someone stuck a cone on the car to confuse it, sometimes someone tore down the posters about AI. Towering office buildings sell software that I cannot begin to explain. People spend a fortune to live in a concrete box next to the buildings that sell software, and you never see anyone walk on those streets on the weekend. An underpaid underclass brings them food. There is a part of town where the military dumped all sorts of classified experiments, some of them radioactive, and they've fenced off parts of it because it's not safe to go there. There is private security everywhere, and private networks of cameras watching every inch of public space. Some of the private security literally has a logo which is an eye in an illuminati pyramid. I would not put that in my cyberpunk game. Nobody would take me seriously. There's always a dangerous slum in cyberpunk, but it's actually not that dangerous, well, not to me - what's dangerous is what they do to the people who live there. A few blocks over you can walk by showrooms selling every gadget imaginable, and VR entertainment systems. A few years ago the smoke was so bad that it blotted out the sun, but that only sometimes happens.

I spend a lot of time in the city walking in parks. There are a lot of parks here: natural and artifical ones, grandiose ones created a hundred years ago and ones where the terrain just cannot support buildings. Canyons and steep hills, giant rock formations. An old military base gives sweeping views of the ocean and of rolling hills. I see at least one coyote most weeks, I see hawks and ravens, and at night sometimes an owl. I saw a great blue heron spear a vole once, and I see the pelicans migrate. In the spring wildflowers pop up everywhere. The people who maintain the roads are fighting an endless battle with the sea and losing. They literally must take truckfuls of sand around the beach to stop it from expanding inland.

This blog post was very much based on this:

Now the temptation might be when I say there is a lot of nature and also it's very cyberpunk to suggest solarpunk. And there are elements there, I could write a whole book. Except the solarpunks, though they don't call themselves that, are themselves a pretty small faction and they are always losing. It's not that you can combine them to understand the city. Instead, both are true of the city, and there are many more cities overlaid on one another. The book this title references - of two cities that are distinct but occupy the same location - is very much how this city works. There are more than two cities, in fact. I am in a different city when I take transit to get around than when I ride my bike or walk. There are cities I know about here because I don't speak the right language. There is a city I could only see if I were richer and a city I could only see if I were poorer. And yes there are neighbourhoods of course and each is distinct - we have so many neighbourhoods - but it's not just that. A city is like a crystal you can hold in your hand and as you rotate it, each facet shows you something completely different. That is the only way you can start to understand a city.

Even if I just wrote what I could see, I couldn't do it justice. I think this is why I mostly write things that are a bit at arm's length, namely mostly fantasy adventure games in a mostly rural setting. One day maybe I'll become a better writer and write about cities.

<h2 class="title">Games I've played</h2>

<h2 class="subtitle">Played</h2>
<p><b>D&D 3.5 (player)</b>
  Had some of my earliest experiences here and by and large did not enjoy it,
  but mostly for cultural reasons. Community was very optimization focused and
  I was more interested in the story aspect and also playing a half orc like the
  ones in OOTS and not like how they were described in the book.
</p>

<p><b>D&D 4E (player, DM)</b><br>
  Played in and ran several campaigns, going up to close to level 20. Enjoyed
  being able to both play with optimizing types and play the types of characters
  I liked, also enjoyed the tactical combat.
</p>

<p><b>13th age (GM mostly, played once)</b><br>
  Very similar to 4E. I prefer 4E's greater complexity, but this supports a
  wider range of play styles.
</p>

<p><b>D&D 5E (player, DM)</b><br>
  Not my favourite, but I don't mind playing it, and it's the easiest to
  schedule especially if I don't want to always DM.
</p>

<p><b>Werewolf the Forsaken (player and DM, PBP)</b><br>
  Game kept dying but it seemed fun
</p>

<p><b>Paranoia (player, once)</b><br>
  Was lots of fun to really get in character and play non-optimally
</p>

<p><b>Heart (GM, PbP)</b><br>
  Game died due to PbP but I enjoyed it and would love to play the system more.
  I did play Corvid Court in real time, though it's not exactly the same system.
</p>

<p><b>Quest (player, PbP)</b><br>
  Wasn't sold on the system but would try it again in a different format.
</p>

<p><b>Honey Heist (GM)</b><br>
  One shot, profoundly silly, everyone seemed to love it.
</p>

<p><b>The Sprawl (Player)</b><br>
  Had fun, I felt the system did not quite match the style of game though.
  Like had fun because of the people, not the game.
</p>

<p><b>Mouse Guard (Player)</b><br>
  Very cute game. Really like the level up approach. Not convinced by the combat
  system.
</p>

<p><b>Fiasco (Player, played once)</b><br>
Had fun, but not sure it would be my first choice to play again.
</p>

<p><b>Follow (Player, played once)</b><br>
I remember very little about the system but I do remember quite enjoying the
game that resulted.
</p>

<p><b>Apocalypse World (Player)</b><br>
  My favourite PbtA I've played. First time I really played a game with PvP that
  worked and was fun. Also first game I played two characters. This is where I
  started understanding this style of play.
</p>

<p><b>Masks (Player)</b><br>
  Wish the game aged up the players a bit. Superhero game + kids means it tends
  to hit a bit too close to home. Enjoyed it because of who I was playing with.
</p>

<p><b>Blades in the Dark (Player, GM)</b><br>
  Really enjoying this one. Love having different characters that you swap out
  as well. Really great setting, great system. We played as a cult which is a
  great way to play. Later on I GMed a one-shot.
</p>

<p><b>Mork Borg (GM)</b><br>
  A lot of fun until I hit a point I hadn't prepped for and had a bit of trouble
  improvising. But definitely sold me on the concept of OSR. Now that I know about
  Ex Libris I won't run out of content. Not sure I want to play a full campaign.
</p>

<p><b>Troika (GM)</b><br>
  Great lightweight system. Love the weirdness of the implied setting. So did
  the players. I like it for one-shots, but it's a bit out of my improv comfort
  zone.
</p>

<p><b>The Corvid Court (GM)</b><br>
  Just realized I could basically put the same description as Troika even though
  they are completely different games in every way.
  Did a fair bit of prep on the setting and I'm glad I did. Might write it up
  at some point.
</p>

<p><b>Thousand Year Vampire (Solo)</b><br>
  Sold me on solo games.

    <title>The Most Important Two Pages of Procedures to Discover the Path Ahead </title>
    <link>https://seedlinggames.com/blogging/extras/ptdtpa_preview.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[ <h1 class="title">The Most Important Two Pages of Procedures to Discover the Path Ahead</h1> <p>I've decided to publish a blog version of the main idea in Procedures to Discover the Path Ahead because I keep wanting to tell people that I wrote something that solves their problem, but I don't want to seem spammy and ask them to buy something.</p> <p>So here is the core mechanic. You have a counter that goes from 0 to 6 and you add the results of a d6 to the counter. You then look up the result in a table. This is basically a depth crawl.</p> <ol> <li>Water</li> <li>Farmland/village</li> <li>Waystation (e.g. an inn, monastery, friendly military post, roadside stalls). Add 1 to the counter.</li> <li>Gentle wilds (rolling hills, meadows, forests that are well explored and used by loggers, hunters, etc). Add 1 to the counter.</li> <li>Farmland/village, again. Add 1 to the counter.</li> <li>Rough wilds (bogs, scary forests, rocky hills, small mountains). Add 2 to the counter.</li> <li>Barrier (Deserts, oceans, mountains). Place up to 2 spaces away and add 2 to the counter when you reach that spot. Have it extend a few spaces in either direction.</li> <li>Unfriendly (monsters, bandits, army of a rival kingdom). Add 1 to the counter.</li> <li>Rough wilds again. Add 1 to the counter.</li> <li>Town, placed 2 spaces away. Reset the counter to 0.</li> <li>Deep wilds: enter the land of the fey, etc.</li> <li>City. Place 3 spaces away and set the counter to 0.</li> </ol> <h1 class="subtitle">Example of a journey</h1> <p>A space can be a hex, a day's travel, an hour's travel, etc.  If you're doing this without a map, I usually roll 2 options and have the option of going one of two ways at each point. For example:</p> <div class="notes"> <p>(Counter 0, roll a 5 and 1) (<strong>farmland</strong>, water) You set off on your journey with the ocean on one side and a seaside village on the other, the road leading through little gardens and orchards. You head through the village. +1</p> <p>(counter 1, you roll a 1 and a 2) (farmland, <strong>waystation</strong>) The path continues into a valley with more villages, but you decide to take a road that will lead you farther afield. You stop for the night in an inn. +1</p> <p>(counter 2, you roll a 5 and a 3) (<strong>barrier</strong>, farmland) The road continues up towards a steep and foreboding mountain range. One fork takes you by some pastoral villages at the foot of the mountains, but you are going on a Journey. You set off to climb through a narrow and treacherous mountain pass. +2</p> <p>(counter 4, 1, 4) (<strong>farmland</strong>, unfriendly) You make it through, exhausted, and see an imposing fort ahead, flying a flag with a skull on it. You instead take refuge in a mountainside village. The food is plain but hearty and you manage to regain your strength. +1</p> <p>(counter 5, 6, 10) (deep wilds, <strong>town</strong>) Before you leave, the villagers point out to you two immense stones in the side of one of the mountains. They tell you that those who pass through often do not return, that it is the gate to some other world. You decide ths sounds like a bad idea. You can see what looks like a town further down in the valley, and decide to head there instead.</p> <p>(counter reset to 0, 6, 3) (rough wilds, <strong>waystation</strong>) The trail does head through a particularly ominous forest, but the villagers tell you that if you stay on the main path and head for the monastery you should be fine. The forest, they tell you, is full of wolves, but they keep off the main path. You follow their advice and reach a monastery, where you spend the night and learn more about the area. It is ruled, they say, by a cruel tyrant (in the castle), but whose grasp on power is fragile. The town is technically under their control, but largely independent.</p> <p>(counter 1 but you've reached the town) You reach the town! We'll end our journey here but we could also set off in a new direction, or return to one of the interesting and dangerous locations you passed up before.</p> </div> <p>I have tables in the book to flesh out each location a bit more, but you could equally well use similar tables in other books. You could use this in conjunction with other game rules: add random encounters, for instance.</p> <p>The goal is to randomly create a map or a journey which also follows a satisfying narrative pattern. Stateless random location generators end up feeling a bit incoherent sometimes, since anything can appear next to anything else. By adding some state, the journey naturally follows a narrative, where it increases in difficulty as you get farther from home, requiring you to reach several obstacles, before reaching your goal. It also feels more naturalistic, with areas near major settlements having smaller settlements and relatively safe areas, and more remote areas being more dangerous. It also means that potential adventure sites  (the portal to a strange world, the mountains, the ominous castle), require some effort to discover.</p> <h1 class="subtitle">Example of a hex map</h1> <p>You can also do this with a hex map. In this case, write the counter number on each hex. When you go to a new hex, take the average of the hexes next to it that you've visted.  You can also pre-seed the map with ocean hexes (e.g. have it be around a bay, or a peninsual like Scandinavia) and it works out pretty well.</p> <p>I mean to eventually have a page walking through an example of making a hex map, but it would make this blog post really long so it's coming later. Here are two maps that I made using this, though:</p> <img class="blog-image-heading" src="./images/map_forest.png" alt="A map of a region with water in two opposite corners, a temple on a plateau and a town to the north, another town to the south, forest to the west and desert to the east." /> <img class="blog-image-heading" src="./images/map-mountains.png" alt="A map showing a mountainous region, with a large city next to a plateau in the north, forest in the middle, a valley to the south with a monastery, water to the west and a town next to the water." /> <h1 class="subtitle">Using this structure for other things</h1> <p>I have some other types of overland journey in the book. One thing I've been meaning to explore, but haven't until now, is using it to generate dungeons. Here's a first attempt:</p> <ol> <li>A temple or other external-facing structure</li> <li>A sealed door +3</li> <li>An incursion from the natural world</li> <li>A minor enemy, guarding a useful item +1</li> <li>A secret revealed or a useful item +1</li> <li>An obvious trap or puzzle +2</li> <li>A passage heading downwards. +3</li> <li>Another entrance. If the dungeon continues, reset counter to 0</li> <li>A powerful enemy +1</li> <li>A sealed door +2</li> <li>An ancient evil unleashed +1</li> <li>A great treasure</li> </ol> <p>On a 6, the dungeon loops back on itself.</p> <p>I tried it out and it makes some decent small dungeons. It currently has no guidance on exits for rooms, I'm just doing what feels right in the moment, but if I made this into something publishable I would probably want to come up with a procedure for that, as well as more guidance for how to actually stock the rooms. I also might want to tweak it to make bigger dungeons. But as a first, off the cuff implementation without any effort spent refining it, I'm pretty happy with it. There are multiple paths and a sense of progress as you go deeper.</p> <img class="blog-image-heading" src="./images/ptdtpa_dungeon.png" alt="A dungeon with a temple, one route that leads to a trap and treasure, another that leads to a monster and then a treasure room beyond as well as sealed ancient evil, and another side route that just has a major monster as well as another entrance." /> <p>(Made with Dungeon Scrawl)</p> <p>Here's a slightly weirder one that I did, that I'm not going to try doing on an actual map. I like that it ended up being very vertical. Also this is the point where I decided we needed another sealed door farther down. It's still super short though - you basically have one choice to make - do you try and fight Big Scary Monster, maybe with the help of Lore, or do you fight the slightly less scary monster and then deal with the door? Or maybe3 the Big Scary Monster leaves to go to the lake sometimes.</p> <img class="blog-image-heading" src="./images/ptdtpa_dungeon_vertical.jpg" alt="A rough sketch of a dungeon. It's surrounded by an underground lake, branches into 'temple' and 'lore' rooms, has a large monster guarding treasure, and a smaller monster with a different route to the treasure" /> <p>If I was playing solo, I'd probably make the room with &quot;lore&quot; be basically a token for something I can then retroactively say applied to the situation.</p> <h1 class="subtitle">General design considerations when writing your own</h1> <ul> <li>The more frequent you increment the counter, the faster it goes.</li> <li>Anything 1-6 can happen on the first roll.</li> <li>Consider things within 6 of each other. Does it make sense for them to occur back to back?.</li> <li>Things in the 3-9 range or so will show up more often.</li> </ul> <p>I don't have a license for this "system" because I think 90% of it isn't copyrightable anyway, aside from the exact wording that I use, and I think there is a tendency for people to over-claim what is copyrightable in the RPG world. I'm happy for you to make use of this or to make your own versions of these tables, and I'd love to hear about it if you do.</p> ]]>

    <title>Two Western Solo Games: Tarnation and God's Gonna Cut You Down </title>
    <link>https://seedlinggames.com/blogging/actualplay/tarnation_ggcyd.html</link>
    <description> <![CDATA[<h2 class="title">Tarnation and God's Going To Cut You Down</h2><h1 class="subtitle">Intro</h1> <p>I recently playtested Tarnation, although unfortunately I never finished the game because I lost the index card I was using. Maybe it'll turn up and then I'll finish it. I then played God's Going To Cut You Down, and realized they are both kind of Western-y games. They're quite different - Tarnation is definitely Weird, and GGCYD is pretty normal. Tarnation guides you through a kind of clock-based story structure where you should hopefully survive; in GGCYD you are doomed and you're playing to find out your downfall.</p> <p>I ended up playing pretty terrible people in both games. Also, for GGCYD maybe I leaned too hard into the tropes of the genre, I have never written anything that less passes the Bechdel test.  I don't think you have to play either character as that terrible though; in particular the example character in the GGCYD book tends to make mistakes more in the context of his religious beliefs, and his ultimate failure is a lot less serious. I don't have a Christian background (religiously or culturally), so I ended up going with someone who is morally flawed in ways I am better at understanding.  I kind of flailed around a bit before I really got my bearings on what was happening as well; Westerns aren't a genre I'm very familiar with either. (Why did I get this game, you ask? I like doomed protagonists, especially when they doomed themselves.)</p> <p>I think the Tarnation one is the best writing I've done in solo journaling so far, maybe because I was finally brave enough to do real dialogue. I am extremely not confident about my ability to write dialogue. Maybe that's why I like writing adventures, because I am making the dialogue someone else's responsibility.</p> <h1  class="subtitle">Tarnation</h1> <div class="notes"> <p><b>Emma Smith</b></p> <ul> <li>Talents: brawling, sleight of hand</li> <li>Personal effects: hidden revolver, deck of cards</li> <li>Companion: a mule named Daisy</li> <li>Cannot abide anyone else in charge</li> </ul> </div> <p>Me and Daisy heard they were looking for us, slipped out just before dawn. They expect people like me to stay up late and sleep in late, but I've always slept lightly. I heard they were asking questions about a man named Jack who'd disappeared, who had last quarreled with me over a card game.</p> <p>I considered throwing away my revolver, but thought I might need it where I was going.</p> <p>Daisy is stubborn but she knows how to walk quiet. As do I.</p> <p>I could barely see the glow of the sun over the horizon but I could tell it was going to be a hot day. The road was dusty so we kept off of it. The dry grass crunched underfoot, and we headed to the other side of the ridge line before anyone woke up.</p> <div class="notes"> <ul> <li>Quicksilver</li> <li>Breakdown</li> <li>Stake: injury</li> <li>Initial bar: 3+</li> </ul> </div> <p>I didn't want to head across the border, I never had before, but they were sure to find me on the road. What I didn't expect was that Daisy would refuse to continue. There was another donkey just into the borderlands. Like Daisy, but silvery. And Daisy was not having it.</p> <p>I'd heard of the quicksilver people. I heard that they would take strange shapes. But why take the shape of my damned mule.</p> <p>Maybe I could turn her loose and she'd walk back to town? Maybe they'd think, then, that I died in the borderlands. But I couldn't bring myself to leave her. I brought some apples with me and I use them to try and coax Daisy forward. I then have an idea. I walk up to the quicksilver donkey and offer it an apple as well.</p> <p>It took the donkey, and then it changed shape. It changed into the shape of Jack. I don't remember falling to the ground.</p> <div class="notes"> <ul> <li>Traveler</li> <li>Disappearance</li> <li>Quicksilver implement</li> <li>6+, lowered to 1+ by raising the bar</li> </ul> </div> <p>I wake up and Daisy is gone. A man is standing by me. He looks confused. &quot;Who are you, and where am I?&quot; he says. He's holding a strange device.</p> <p>&quot;Where's my mule?&quot; I reply.</p> <p>&quot;I can find them,&quot; he says, gesturing to the device, &quot;not that I've seen them. But look. I mean you no harm. Tell me where I am and I'll point you in the direction of the mule.&quot;</p> <p>Without thinking, I name the town. He frowns. &quot;I've heard of it. Collected a bounty there once, many years ago.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;You're a bounty hunter?&quot; I say, trying to sound casual.</p> <p>&quot;I suppose so. Name's Tom. I like to think of myself as more someone who tries to bring some justice to this world. Real justice, you know, not The Law.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Name's Myrtle&quot;, I say, saying the first name that comes to mind.</p> <p>&quot;Well, I better head into town in any case. Get my bearings, get breakfast, then head back.&quot; He fiddles with some dials. &quot;What's your mule's name?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Daisy.&quot;</p> <p>He squints. &quot;Closest thing named Daisy is uh thatwaways. Looks like she's ranged, though. Do you know how to range?&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Never done it.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;It's not safe. Maybe better to head back into town with me. There are criminals and such about too, you know.&quot;</p> <p>I realize this is my best shot, when his hands are full and he's looking down. I don't want to do it. It started with Jack and now it's going to be Tom and who knows where my life is headed now. But if Tom makes it back to town, he'll be hunting me next, and his revolvers look well-used. So I shoot while his head is down. I grab the device before it falls and crashes on the ground. For some reason, running seems right. Maybe from my guilt.</p> <p>It's a good thing I ran, because a bullet whizzes by over top. Just before I flicker, I hear a voice behind me.</p> <p>&quot;You poor fool, Myrtle. You really do not know the border lands.&quot;</p> <p>Daisy is on the other side, where it's cold and the land is dotted with  the closest thing we ever get to trees here. I don't know if he followed me, and Daisy for once doesn't complain when I jump on her back and run. I don't know if he followed me, this man who I saw die, but I've lost him for now.</p> <h1 class="subtitle">God's Gonna Cut You Down</h1> <p>I'm a baker. I have gotten in a big fight with someone, many years ago, and they're now the mayor. Now my fight is everyone's fight, and people are quietly picking sides. </p> <h2 class="subsubtitle">Chapter 1</h2> <div class="notes"><p>Note that the 3 numbers below are from a table for 3d6's. A d666 table, some would say. Lol. I'm going to leave out listing the threads, they're mostly useful while you're writing and I only have the final version for each chapter.</p></div> <p><em>Verse 1: 5:3:4 feed the poor</em></p> <p>On a whim, I give free bread to Anne, whose farm is struggling. She goes from being cold and distant to friendly and grateful. Word gets around and I give bread to those in need. I can't keep it up forever, but I'm winning some of the town back.</p> <p><em>Verse 2: 4:2:3 restore what you deceitfully gained</em></p> <p>I realize that I have mistakenly underpaid the miller. The miller is the mayor's cousin. I reluctantly admit that I have overpaid him and give him the money back, hoping to bolster my reputation by my honesty. Instead he accuses me of being just afraid of angering the mayor. Rumours spread that I was deceitful in my business dealings.</p> <p><em>Verse 3: 6:2:4 don't break vows</em></p> <p>I had promised Anne free bread, and don't have the flour for it. But a promise is a promise. I tell her this will have to the be last time.</p> <p><em>Verse 4: 2:2:2 don't steal/lie/deal falsely</em></p> <p>My old friend the Salesman is back in town. This time he has a grift - he's selling snake oil. He offers to cut me in on it if I can sell it in my shop. I desperately need the money but I can't prove the mayor right and stoop to such dishonesty.</p> <p><em>Verse 5: 3:2:6 another one about mercy and truth</em></p> <p>Anne's son is sick and is trying to buy the snake oil from the Salesman in the inn. I know she can't afford it. I reveal what he said to me in front of the whole town. I've made an enemy.</p> <p><em>Verse 6. 4:3:1 (false witness)</em> - <b>failed!</b></p> <p>My son sets fire to the bakery. Insurace won't pay out if it's him. I say I saw the Salesman do it. The timing is right. People believe it. He flees in the night.</p> <h2 class="subsubtitle">Chapter 2</h2> <p><b><i>A few weeks later...</i></b></p> <p><em>Verse 1: 5:6:6 Swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath</em></p> <p>The mayor makes a speech against dishonest merchants. He is clearly targeting me. The Miller implies I set the fire on purpose to scam insurance. I say nothing. I don't even acknowledge it.</p> <p><em>Verse 2: 3:3:3  Love the stranger</em></p> <p>A new person comes into town. They seem disreputable, they come in with a bullet wound. People in the community don't want him here, they want him to move on. He comes to me for help specifically - he heard from a beggar I gave out free bread. I help him with great reluctance.</p> <p><em>Verse 3: 2:5:5 Thine own friend, and father's friend, forsake not</em></p> <p>My son confesses to me that he set the fire, he is afraid that I blamed my friend by mistake and that he set us apart. He wants to go find him and bring him some of the gold. I, too, am feeling guilty, and the mysterious stranger has given me an equally mysterious sum of gold, so I can afford it now. I send him off with my blessing.</p> <p><em>(oops I've been doing wrong number of dice)</em></p> <p><em>Verse 4: 1:6:4 (don't partake of other men's sins)</em> -  <strong>failed!</strong></p> <p>It turns out the stranger is a wanted man, and someone comes looking for him. He tells me that if he is found at my house, I will be ruined, everyone will think  me a criminal - and I think of the mayor and how he'd use this. I just need to help him escape. So I do. I hear gunfire that night, and try not to think about it.</p> <h2 class="subsubtitle">Chapter 3</h2> <p>It's been a month and my son is still missing.</p> <p><em>Verse 1: 5:6:5 Redeem firstborn son</em></p> <p>(Wow, this is way too appropriate)</p> <p>I hear my son was arrested. It is he, not I, who is now being blamed: he had the stolen gold, and he confessed to the Salesman that I lied about who set the fire.</p> <p>The Salesman writes me a letter. My son will go to prison if I don't go. I go.</p> <p><em>Verse 2: 5:3:5 Do not bear a grudge</em></p> <div class="notes"> <p>At this point I realized why the mayor and the protagonist hate each other. I realized that a wife has been notably missing this entire story. Maybe she died in childbirth, and the mayor had some connection to her, and blames the protagonist for what happened. I feel like the protagonist must be at fault here in other people's eyes for this confict to make sense - I think he had a child out of wedlock and refused to marry her.</p> </div> <p>Before I go, I go to the mayor and I apologize. I say that I was wrong, many years ago, and more wrong to hold onto my anger. The mayor is overcome with sadness. Things could have been so different, so many years ago. I don't know what has happened to you to give you some capacity for self-reflection. I tell him I'm leaving town and I hope to be back but I don't know if I will. I tell him I am going to get my son back. He tells me that looking after my son is the one decent thing I've done in my life and not to bother returning if I don't return with my son. I get him to promise that if my son comes back alone, he will look after him.</p> <p><em>Verse 3: 6:1:5 thou shall not kill</em> - <b>failed!</b></p> <p>(Another overly approriate one. Though it was my second roll, I skipped the first one, I don't remember what it was but it was too similar to a previous one.)</p> <p>The trial of my son is tomorrow. I meet the Salesman. We have a bitter argument. He says I'm the worst kind of hypocrite, willing to destroy anyone to make myself look better. This is not how I imagined it going. I finally tell him that I'll admit to letting him take the fall for the fire, to free my son, but too many words have been said. The Salesman shrugs and says, like father, like son, it wasn't an accident, I know you burned it down for the insurance. You sent your son with blood money, you threw me under the bus to distract from your dealings with bandits and murderers. I pull out a knife and stab him. They would hang me either way, and now I get to tell the story.</p> <p>My son goes free.</p> <p>I think in my last night about how all my troubles started with that first sin, against Emilia, so many years ago. How as a young man I was foolish and thoughtless. How I tried to be a good father, but my anger at the mayor - my shame - kept me from doing so. And how I let that shame fester and grow larger and larger until it killed people, and finally me.</p>]]>

    <title>20 Virtues And/Or Vices</title>
    <link>https://seedlinggames.github.io/blogging/wip/values.html</link>
    <description> <![CDATA[<h2 class="title">20 Virtues And/Or Vices</h2> <p><i>Recently, I wrote a different blog post that gave some background context behind me writing this, <a href="../discourse/problem_with_alignment.html"> here.</a></i></p> <p>I've been working on my own quasi-alignment system for well over a year now and I'm pretty happy about how it's been able to create NPCs (and PCs) with interesting motivations. It consists of 20 values in 10 opposing pairs, which I tried to phrase neutrally, and which I hope could characterize either a protagonist or an antagonist. I mostly have created it with fantasy adventure games in mind, although it's probably more universally applicable.</p> <p>The complete list:</p> <ol> <li><a href="#mercy"> Mercy vs Ruthlessness</a></li> <li><a href="#courage">Courage vs Prudence</a></li> <li><a href="#cunning"> Cunning vs Honesty</a></li> <li><a href="#ambition">Ambition vs Humility</a></li> <li><a href="#impartiality"> Impartiality vs Loyalty</a> </li> <li><a href="#sacrifice">Self-Sacrifice vs Survival</a></li> <li><a href="#passion">Passion vs Stoicism</a></li> <li><a href="#asceticism">Asceticism vs Extravagance</a></li> <li><a href="#frankness">Frankness vs Propriety</a></li> <li><a href="#novelty">Novelty vs Tradition</a></li> </ol> <h3 class="subtitle">How To Use</h3> <p>While you could go down the list and pick one of each, I find it's easier to make and portray a memorable character if you pick a small number that are important to them. I typically roll a few times. A d20, with 1-10 being the first part of the pair and 11-20 being the second allows you to randomly select a few. I usually do two values for NPCs and three for PCs. Picking just one tends to make characters that are, well, one-dimensional. I skip any repeats or any opposite pairs.</p> <p>The first 6 are probably more deeply held values, with the last 4 being more something that can set the style, look, or attitude of the NPC, so you could instead roll a d12 and just consider the first 6. Or roll a d12 for one of the values and a d20 for the other.</p> <p>Another option is to roll a 1d10 and pick based on what makes sense for the character. A classic heroic story might have the heroes always choose mercy over ruthlessness and courage over pragmatism, for instance.</p> <p> <b>Factions:</b> I'll often also give one or two values for factions. Individual members of the faction might vary, but groups as a whole can have shared values. An order of knights might value courage and self-sacrifice, but the particular knight you meet might seem largely motivated by ambition.</p> <p><b>Reaction rolls:</b> A quick and easy social mechanic can be that matching values result in a positive reaction, and clashing values result in a negative reaction.  It oversimplifies the breadth of human experience, but so do any social mechanics.  Alternately, you could have it modify reaction rolls. Roll twice and take the higher if the values match, roll twice and take the lower if they clash. Then any result is still possible but shared values skews the results. <h3 class="subtitle">More On Each Set Of Values</h3> <p><i>This part is way too long, but I need to stop spending time on this and get the blog post out.</i></p> <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="mercy">Mercy vs Ruthlnessnes</h4> <p>I've been struggling a lot with the second word; I'm looking for something both neutral and specific.</p> <p>Do the ends justify the means? Do your enemies deserve a second chance, or will sparing them only lead to further evil? Someone who believes in mercy might see their opposites as cruel, and someone who believes in ruthlesness might see their opposites as weak or naive.</p> <p>Protagonists who embody mercy could be healers, pacifists (religious or otherwise), or rogues who use stealth to avoid violence. Those who embody ruthlessness are probably antiheroes: they  might be assassins, the person you call in when a hard but necessary task is needed; revolutionaries or those otherwise forced to exist in a ruthless environment. When they coexist in a party, there might be a tension between the two, but an understanding that different methods are needed at different times, and maybe a certain amount of pretending to not know what is happening.</p> <p>Ruthless villains are sort of the default, but if this comes up, maybe they are willing to kill the party for relatively trivial reasons. A merciful antagonist might be a knight who insists on fighting everyone who wants to cross the bridge, but not to the death; a hive-mind of strange beings that decides you will be happier if you are absorbed into the colony and never allowed to leave; a king who is in denial about the harm he is causing and refuses to let anyone speak of any such unpleasantness.</p> <p>This is one where the exact meaning of the values should be in line with your table's boundaries as to what to play in a game.</p> <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="courage">Courage vs Prudence</h4> <p>Someone who believes in courage might see prudence as cowardice, and someone who believes in prudence might see courage as foolishness, recklessness or irresponsibility.</p> <p>Protagonists who embody courage might include berserkers, monster-hunters, or rogues performing extreme feats of acrobatics. Adventurers necessarily lean somewhat towards courage, but someone embodying prudence might be forced into adventuring through circumstance, or have learned through hard-won experience that prudence is the secret to a long adventuring career. Magic-users or stealthy hunters might better embody prudence. When coexisting in a party, it makes sense for each to fall into roles that take advantage of their predispositions.</p> <p>An antagonist who exemplifies courage might fight until the last breath; glorify warfare as an end in and of itself, or might be an automaton incapable of self-preservation. An antagonist who exemplifies prudence might be a mastermind who plots behind the scenes, or one who only ever fights from a position of strength, falling apart if they are ever outnumbered.</p> <p>In the context of adventuring this is mostly physical courage, but courage (and prudence) can take other forms in other settings. This is also one where courage could take different dimensions: a brave fighter may be afraid to take an unpopular moral stand. Interpret this as whatever form of courage is most relevant to your setting.</p> <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="cunning">Cunning vs Honesty</h4> <p>An honest character might place a lot of stock in their word or in their honour; a cunning one is willing to use lies and deception.  Think Gawain vs Loki or Odysseus. A cunning character might see an honest one as naive or gullible; a honest one might see a cunning character as dishonest.</p> <p>Protagonists who are cunning are more likely to fall into a trickster archetype. Rogues, illusionists and performers might be cunning, whereas warriors who adhere to a code of honour are often depicted as honest. Religious figures are often expected to be honest. There are a lot of stories which pair an honest and cunning character together for comic effect, which might be good inspiration for how characters with opposite values can get along.</p> <p>Antagonists who embody honesty might be supernatural beings incapable of lying; they might find it amusing to keep the letter but not the spirit of their word; they might implacably hunt the party down because they broke an oath; or they might think a strict code of honour is a substitute for morality. Antagonists who use cunning might use traps or spies; they might be monsters that mimic the player's voices; they might be supernatural beings with very dangerous ideas of a funny prank.</p> <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="ambition">Ambition vs Humility</h4> <p>Ambitious characters strive for power (magical, political, or otherwise), wealth, fame, status, respect or personal excellence, and might look down on those who don't seek those things. A character that values humility has no desire to seek these things, and might be distainful or untrusting of those who do. They might have a more egalitarian outlook, or believe that everyone should stay in their proper place in the existing hierarchies of the world.</p> <p>An adventurer who exemplifies ambition might be actively working towards wealth or power: ruling over a domain, acqurining powerful magic, or making pacts with dangerous beings. Many level-based games assume a certain level of ambition, and so if you pick this one, have it be somewhat more than the baseline. An adventurer exemplifying humility might have devoted their life to a religious order; they could be a rogue openly distainful of nobility; a druid who views the ambitions of human society as frivolous. Different attitudes towards this value don't have to clash if everyone respects each other's paths in life.</p> <p>An antagonist motivated by ambition might be trying to take over the world (or kingdom, or town); they might be trying to unlock powerful magic better left alone; they could be friendly competitors who keep showing up at every turn to try and snatch away a goal only one group can achieve. An antagonist motivated by humility could be a spirit that punishes hubris; an official who thinks the party needs to be shown their proper place in the kingdom; cultists who seek to have everyone bow to the will of their god.</p> <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="impartiality">Impartiality vs Loyalty</h4> <p>Loyal characters put their friends, family, community, leader or organization ahead of the rest of the world, whereas impartial characters treat everyone equally. Loyalty is an often overlooked motivation for a group to stick together given any other obvious reason.</p> <p>Loyal characters have a strong reason to stick together as an adventuring party; impartial characters need another reason, such as duty or money. They might be a mercenary, or be here because it's their job and they've been assigned to this task. Criminal organizations traditionally stick together through loyalty enforced by violence.</p> <p>A loyal antagonist could be a henchperson, a closely knit group of evil friends, someone from a different community who hates your community, a monster who kills anyone who it things has wronged its unwitting friend, or an otherwise noble knight who tragically feels obliged to follow an evil lord. An impartial antagonist might demonstrate equal cruelty to their followers as to the players; or mercenaries who will oppose you as long as they get paid; a monster that attacks both you and your enemies equally; a literal force of nature; an unbribeable judge who is determined to bring the party to justice for their misdeeds.</p> <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="sacrifice">Self-Sacrifice vs Survival</h4> <p>A self-sacrificing character is willing to suffer or even be willing to die for what they think is important. A character focused on survival is, well, focused on survival, which might include a loved one or close family members.</p> <p>A protagonist who embodies self-sacrifice may be more of a traditional hero, or they may have given up a lot for power. One who embodies survival may be more of an anti-hero if they're in a high-powered fantasy setting: they might have a backstory where they have had to survive, or a well-meaning mercenary. In a post-apocalyptic or horror setting, being oriented towards survival may be more the default.</p> <p>An antagonist motivated by survival might be focused on trying to extend their life,  or be some kind of monster that is only dangerous because it feels threatened, or be someone who betrayed you to protect their family. An antagonist motivated by self-sacrifice might be a fanatic devoted to a greater cause, or they may have made a terrible bargain for power. They could be creatures that explode on contact or otherwise die like bees to protect a larger group.</p> <p>There are some similarities with courage vs prudence. But a prudent advisor, say, might always advise avoiding risk, and then when their advice is ignored, stick around to help out until the very end. A brave mercenary might do any job for the right price, as long as there's a chance of survival, but they're gone as soon as the money stops coming.</p> <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="passion">Passion vs Stoicism</h4> <p>Passionate characters express emotions freely and exhuberantly, and might see those who don't as untrustworthy or insufficiently sincere. Calm characters value control over their emotions and might see their opposites as immature.</p> <p>In terms of fantasy archetypes, barbarians and bards would generally be more passionate, whereas monks and paladins are more stoic. Magic-users might use passion to power their magic, or be required to be stoic to remain control. This and the remaining ones are somewhat less serious as values go, and so while you might play up character differences for comedy, there is no reason that within a party they would have to cause conflict.</p> <p>A passionate antagonist might be a villain who flies into a terrible rage; a supernatural being whose songs leave you transfixed by sadness or your mind clouded by ecstatic joy, or an immortal undead who staves off the boredom of eternity with cruelty. A stoic antagonist might be an icy cold tyrant; a supernatural being that doens't understand your pain or fear; a religious figure who views strong feelings as weakness that leads to evil.</p> <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="asceticism">Asceticism vs Extravagance</h4> <p>Ascetic characters take pride in needing very little of the comforts of life. They might dress simply, own few things, prefer a lack of ornament, eat plain food, and abstain from drink or other intoxicants. An extravagant character might wear elaborate clothing, be fond of food or drink, or the other comforts of life. They may not necessarily pursue all of these: they could be a wealthy noble, or like the hobbits eat 6 meals a day, or spend every coin as soon as they get it.</p> <p>In terms of fantasy archetypes, some religious figures might be expected to wear plain clothing and live plain lives, whereas others might wear elaborate vestments or hold feasts for the glory of their gods. A druid might distain the comforts of civilization, or believe that you should enjoy the bounty of the natural world as much as possible. A knight might revel in the wealth of their position or believe that a spartan lifestyle strengthens their ability to fight. </p> <p>Extravagance can be a good motivation for a more heist-themed game: trying to steal the most elaborate cake, most beautiful cape, or rarest wine for instance can be more of a fun premise than just stealing money. Conversely, a more ascetic character might grow dissatisfied with the luxuries of living in a house like a normal person and feel driven to go seek out  the simplicity and even discomfort of adventuring life.</p> <p>An ascetic villain might include religious extremists, a frighteningly disciplined army, a miserly lord who hoards the taxes extracted from peasants, or a lich contemptuous of your weak and fleshy bodies. Good extravagant villains might include a vampire count, a greedy lord who wastes the taxes extracted from peasants, an elven court or a rival bard.</p> <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="frankness">Frankness vs Propriety</h4> <p>Someone who values frankness might see the other as being dishonest or insincere; someone who values propriety might see the other as being rude or boorish. Propriety is likely to be valued when meeting the king; frankness might be valued more in the barracks. People often switch between these to some degree as needed, but others firmly stick to one or the other.</p> <p>In protagonists, this probably depends more on your background than anything else. Courtiers, diplomats and merchants are more likely to value propriety, but frankness might mean you have the status to get away with speaking your mind. Warriors and others for whom power comes from action rather than speech might tend to be more frank, or they migh speak more carefully because an insult can lead to death. Magic and religion might require precise, careful and polite speech.</p> <p>A villain who values propriety could be in a court full of intrigue and backstabbing, or the court of the fey where rudeness can lead to death. They could be someone who prefers to couch what they do in euphemisms. A villain who values frankness might respect the party for insulting them to their face (but still intend to kill them).</p> <h4 class="subsubtitle" id="novelty">Novelty vs Tradition</h4> <p>Do you stay in your hometown or always want to see what is over the next horizon? Do you stick to the traditional obligations of your role or break from them? </p> <p>A protagonist motivated by tradition might be a member of an ancient order or religion. They may have traveled far from home but keep to the things they learned in their childhood. Dwarves in fantasy often exemplify this. A protagonist motivated by novelty may have left their home out of wanderlust or a desire to see the world. They could clash with the expectations of where they grew up - for instance, a noble who ran away from home because court protocol was stifling, or someone who left town so they would not be forced to take over the family business.</p> <p>An antagonist who values tradition might be hunting down one of the adventurers to make them adhere to an unwanted role; they might be an undead being who is determined to return the world to how it was 1000 years ago; a village where human sacrifice is just how they've always done things. A villain who values novelty could be a dragon that collects people like people used to collect butterflies, a wizard with a terrible new invention, or a monster that eats brains to absorb your experiences.</p> <p>As a side note, this is a tricky one to give serious examples for, especially for antagonists who value novelty, because the notion of tradition vs novelty exists in the context of us living in the modern world, to some degree. In the past this might have manifested as a genuine belief that people should not step outside of the expectations of tradition and society. I don't think this is a likely attitude of player characters, though. Starting maybe with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, though, you start getting different attitudes about changes happening in society due to science or otherwise. Much as Tolkien denies it, LotR is probably in part about the industrialization of war, contrasted with the nostalgic and pastoral life of the hobbits. Or you could keep this confict as a set of minor character traits. </p> <h3 class="subtitle">Poll results and more on develolping this list</h3> <p>To get some idea as to whether these alignments make sense, I <a href="https://dice.camp/deck/@seedling/112859101086002106"> asked on mastodon which one people think apply to them.</a> I had about 25-35 answers on each question, and I got enough balance that I'm happy with it: </p> <ul> <li>Courage vs Prudence: 62% vs 38%</li> <li>Honesty vs Cunning: 61% vs 39%</li> <li>Ambition vs Humility: 20% vs 80%</li> <li>Loyalty vs Impartiality: 42% vs 58%</li> <li>Mercy vs Ruthlessness: 79% vs 21%</li> <li>Self-sacrifice vs Survival: 40% vs 60%</li> <li>Passion vs Calm: 40% vs 60%</li> <li>Asceticism vs Extravagance: 54% vs 46%</li> <li>Propriety vs Frankness: 29% vs 71%</li> <li>Tradition vs Novelty: 28% vs 72%</li> </ul> <p>The least balanced one is ambition vs humility, followed by mercy vs ruthlesnness. These conflicts might be more prominent in stories than in real life, and these are two I feel I have to inclue regardless. </p> <p>For the approximately 70/30 ones, we had propriety vs frankness and tradition vs novelty. I think this split is reflective of the values of the culture that I personally exist in, rather than a universal trend. For the rest I was pleased to see a more even split. These included some of the ones I was most afraid I had just made up, so I'm glad to see that they divide people in real life as well.</p> <p>I cut two since when I started: one was &quot;wisdom vs innocence&quot; - I was trying to get at how some cultures value youth more (ours tends to, to some degree) and others value age more, but I felt it was both hard to convey in one word as well as hard to make it actually appear in how an individual character behaves.</p> <p>The other one I cut was was justice vs - well I couldn't quite find a second word. Accepting things as they are. The desire to change the world for the better vs the belief that the current nature of things are unavoidable. Between struggling to find a way to concisely articulate the concept, and the fact that it has some overlap with other values, meant I decided to cut it, conveniently leaving the final list at 20.</p>]]>

    <title>The Problem With Classical Alignment As Character Traits</title>
    <link>https://seedlinggames.com/blogging/discourse/problem_with_alignment.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<p><i>Hopefully I remain sufficiently obscure that this post doesn't break containment and make a lot of people angry. If it does I only accept replies on Mastodon, or as blog posts but only if I happen to follow your blog already.</i></p> <h2 class="title">The Problem With Classical Alignment As Character Traits</h2> <p>Originally I was writing a totally different blog post. I still am, but that blog post got so out of hand that I had to break the part about why I'm writing it at all into another blog post.</p> <p>I don't think that Good vs Evil or Law vs Chaos are useful ways of defining characters unless you are playing an extremely specific type of game. As values, these are so broad as to be useless in characterizing anyone, and also inherently impossible to define in a way everyone can agree on.</p> <p><b>The problem with Good and Evil:</b> Most people would agree that their values are Good and values unlike theirs are Evil, by definition. Prominent figures in RPG history have definitively stated that certain actions are Good which I would consider unambiguously Evil. If anyone ever describes their values as being Evil they are usually doing so to be subversive or rebellious, usually to oppose an authority who has the power to define Good and is using that power for evil. You can tell stories about an evil villain who enthusiastically embraces evil for no particular reason, but that isn't usually what people are interested in most of the time. </p> <p><b>The problem with Law and Chaos:</b> This seems like the more interesting and sophisticated pair, but that is only because Law and Chaos are so impossible to define as to be meaningless. Ok, so barbarians are chaotic because they live outside of society's norms. But which society's norms? Presumably not their own. Lawful Good characters uphold the law (unless the law is unjust) and Chaotic Good characters oppose unjust laws - but this seems to say more about the quality of the laws than anything. If Lawful characters adhere to a strict internal code, people who are opposed to authority can have some of the strictest moral codes. And if you define "Chaos" as "acts randomly and for no reason", then Chaotic characters are both annoying and unrealistic. Law and Chaos define an assortment of different spectrums of values that can be in opposition to each other. </p> <p>The one way that a Law vs Chaos axis can be interesting is if Law and Chaos are fundamental forces of the universe, rather than character traits. I tihnk it's even possible for Good and Evil to be interesting in the same way, but only if they are slightly disjoint from actual morality. Consider Good Omens as an example of this. Or maybe taken farther, His Dark Materials.</p> <p>I actually think the 9 square classic alignment chart has remained popular precisely because it is so confusing and ambiguous. You can argue about what it means to be Good or Evil or Lawful or Chaotic forever. Because it's a topic that is very good at generating endless Internet arguments with no possible conclusion, it has an outsized footprint on the larger TTRPG culture.</p> <h3 class="subtitle">Do you have an alternate suggestion?</h3> <p>I do in fact, I have a blog post that I'm writing, but it has grown out of control to the extent that this blog post is actually broken out of the draft of the other one. Although, to be honest, I made this list because a lot of other people have made lists of values to define characters, and I haven't been satisfied with any of them.</p> <p>These are the goals I had in mind when defining this one:</p> <ol> <li>Values should be relatively objective. Of couse it's impossible for values to be truly objective, but people are generally going to have an easier time agreeing on what &quot;impartial&quot; means and what such a character might look like, versus &quot;good&quot;.</li> <li>Values should result in interesting, complex characters.</li> <li>Arbitrary combinations of values should be both plausible and interesting.</li> <li>Each value should be able to produce both a protagonist and an antagonist, and should be phrased in a way someone might describe themselves.</li> <li>There should be real life people who align with each, and who would be proud of doing so.</li> <li>Opposing values should clash, and it should feel natural that they clash. They should generate conflicts that feel natural and human.</li> </ol> <p>I did not try to make all the values have the same level of seriousness. I didn't try and make them be topics I personally am neutral on either, even if I try to describe them neutrally.</p> <p>I brainstormed ideas by a mix of thinking of the cultures and subcultures, past and present, that I'm aware of, including religious and political cultures, supplemented by a lot of reading Wikipedia. I came up with 24, which after about a year I have narrowed down to 20 that I like, a convenient number to pick from randomly using commonly used dice. </p> <h3 class="subtitle">The complete list</h3> <ol> <li>Mercy vs Ruthlessness</li> <li>Courage vs Prudence</li> <li>Cunning vs Honesty</li> <li>Ambition vs Humility</li> <li>Impartiality vs Loyalty</li> <li>Self-Sacrifice vs Survival</li> <li>Passion vs Stoicism</li> <li>Asceticism vs Extravagance</li> <li>Frankness vs Propriety</li> <li>Novelty vs Tradition</li> </ol> <p>This is still a bit of a work in progress. I feel like these require some explanation (coming soon in a later blog post). But I think it is already apparent just from reading this that meaningful conflict can stem from these values. For instance, I expect the reception to this post to relate to differing values with regards to <i>Tradition</i> and <i>Novelty</i>. </p>]]>

    <title>Thoughts on Tome of Tombs and 1400 </title>
    <link>https://seedlinggames.com/blogging/other_games/tome_of_tombs_1400.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the second in my <a href="glide_first_impressions.html">extremely infrequent</a> series of not-reviews. I don't consider myself a proper reviewer, and I'm not going to talk about games I don't like. I will maybe give some idea of whether or not you might like the game too.</p> <p>These games have nothing to do with each other, they are grouped into one blog post because of the physical proximity of the two in my zine pile.</p> <h2 class="title">1400</h2> <p>So I haven't actually played any 24xx game. I really want to, but I want someone else to GM it, so it might be a while. So take my thoughts with a grain of salt.</p> <p>You might like this if:</p> <ul> <li>You're an experienced GM and your players are new to RPGs and want something simple and easy to learn</li> <li>You're an experienced GM and you want something that is very rules lite, but not necessarily ItO style</li> <li>You have been playing 5E but you &quot;almost never roll the dice&quot;</li> </ul> <p>You might not like this if</p> <ul> <li>You aren't very comfortable improvising or making rulings based off of fairly sparse text</li> <li>You're a strict classic OSR type</li> <li>You want a lot of character options or tactical complexity</li> </ul> <p>I got this mostly because I wanted a physical copy of a 24xx game, but I think if I had to run one, I would feel most comfortable running this, since I know what a fantasy game looks like, and you could probably run a lot of different modules based on it.</p> <p>There are really 5 games in here, each of which cover a genre.</p> <ul> <li>QUEST - kind of generic, default fantasy. Feels like it's meant to be a replacement for mainstream D&amp;D like 5E: the setting feels high fantasy, you ignore minor transactions. I feel like people might want slightly more variation in character ancestry - if I was playing with 5E players I would probbly borrow from PLANES.</li> <li>BELOW - more OSR-y, a focus on dungeon crawling</li> <li>SNEAK feels like it captures a lot of the essence of BitD - BitD is a complicated system, and I wonder how using this system to play in Duskvol would work. It dips a bit into what I think of story game mechanics: flashbacks in particular. I mostly thought of 24XX as being OSR-adjacent but I guess it doesn't have to be. Or maybe those two things aren't so different from each other. The implied setting is more classic fantasy though with liches and elves and all that</li> <li>MAGE - not totally sure what this is a reference to, but high powered, everyone-is-a-wizard fantasy seems like an obvious genre people would want to play</li> <li>PLANES - it's planescape . Well sort of. Whatever genre that is. It also feels kind of fresh. There is some inspiration from The Golden Compass series. It does not feel very  much like Troika. There are some interesting planes in there.</li> </ul> <p>All magic etc items, spells, etc are like 1-2 words. You'd have to agree together on what it means.</p> <p>There are some interesting rules for mixing and matching backgrounds from different games - I think I personally would only do it to a limited degree.</p> <p>There's an adventure in the back that is supposed to be playable with all 5 games. I feel like for some of the games though they would shine best if you took them in a different direction.</p> <h2 class="title">Tome of Tombs</h2> <p>You might like this if:</p> <ul> <li>You love worldbuilding</li> <li>You get a bit carried away with prep and you think going deep into the social background of funerary practices would be nice</li> <li>You want to find ways to add more interesting and complex lore to your dungeons</li> </ul> <p>You might not like this if:</p> <ul> <li>You're looking for something super focused on gameability</li> <li>You're looking for what you might traditionally think of a dungeon generation tool</li> </ul> <p>One big problem with books of random tables is that it's hard to tell if the random tables are good or not. Often they are generic, things you could have come up with yourself. The ones in this book are good: unique, interesting, and grounded in historical knowledge that I don't have. It's a book that helps flesh out a world and makes it more real; it's not 100% focused on what to bring to the table, as it says explicitly on one of the pages. It's also an enjoyable read.</p> <p>There are a series of pages starting from how the tombs might fit into society, to how it looks visually approaching them, to the grave goods and methods of burial. Some entries on different tables mesh with each other better than others, you'll want to use your judgement in how many tables to roll on and which ones. I tried just doing one thing from each table and it didn't quite work.</p> <p>I think the author did their own art and it's quite nice.</p> <p class="subtitle">Putting together a tomb</p> <p>The graves are in the center of the community: the town square where official government events happen. The path there is marked with statues of gods of the underworld. The plaza however is no longer in use: it was part of a system of government that is no longer relevant.</p> <p>The gate to the cemetery is decorated with mythical figures representing the guardians of the land of the dead. The cemetery consists of orderly bodies in rows, unmarked, under the flagstones. If you were to dig them up you would find jumbled bones, stripped of their flesh before being buried. The area is behind tall stone walls, and it is always cold here. The sun shines dimly in the sky, as though from further away than normal.</p> <p>On one side is a shrine, with small clay statues perhaps representing the deceased buried under the flagstones. Small bowls for offerings now stand empty. On the other is a mausolem whch is a small model of a palace which once stood in the city.</p> <p>To enter the mausoleum you enter through the carved jaws of an enormous primordial snake. Inside are rooms full of jars of grain, chests of bolts of cloth, each sealed with a fading scroll: if you could read it, you would see these are tax records, the last year of taxes that were still owed to the king after death.</p> <p>Continue further and it opens into a cave, a strangely natural structure, older than anything here. Wards have been carved onto the walls in languages older than the ones who built this cemetery - wards as a barrier between worlds - but some have been symbolically broken.</p> <p>A single body is on an elaborate raised platform, decorated with gold and jewels. They were buried in a simple shroud, though, which is almost entirely rotted away. The head has been embalmed, however, and rests beneath a stone mask. They were buried holding a steel staff, it seems.</p> <p>Spectres are often found around the complex, though they cannot pass through the outer gate so long as it is closed. This is a place where you can pass from the land of the dead to the land of the living, or vice versa.</p> <p>Other interested parties:</p> <ul> <li>A demon who is here to round up some loose souls is actually pretty friendly, so long as you don't interfere.</li> <li>Some supposed heirs of the old royal dynasty are looking for the Staff of Command, said to be buried here, which will allow them to retake their throne.</li> <li>Cultists seek to break open the walls between the land of the living and the land of the dead</li> </ul>]]></description>

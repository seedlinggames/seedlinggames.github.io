Seedling Games makes adventures and other content for D&D, 13th age, as well as standalone indie games and games for indie systems like BOLT.
 In addition, Seedling Games makes maps and other resources for GMs and for TTRPG writers producing commercial content. Seedling Games also started out as a personal blog about worldbuilding, which still continues both in blog posts and in her approach to adventure writing.</p>

 <p>As well, she practices several pre-modern crafts including spinning, dyeing textiles, and blacksmithing. While she uses her interests to bring touches of authenticity to pre-modern fantasy worlds, she rejects ahistorical claims that historical fantasy is at odds with diversity.</p>

<p class="title"> Published Content - Games </p>
<p>All of this started with the <a href="https://www.rpgwriterworkshop.com/">Summer 2020 RPG Writer's Workshop</a>, a resource I greatly recommend.</p>

A one-shot adventure for 5e (13th age coming soon) set on a journey through a post-apocalyptic wasteland, featuring many dinosaurs: as enemies, as mounts, as pets. Only loosely linked to "A Gathering Storm", but can follow that adventure.

A one-shot adventure for 5e and 13th age (<a href="https://seedling.itch.io/a-gathering-storm-13th-age?src=personalsite">sold separately</a>) where players put a stop to a rainstorm that threatens the surrounding area, first by uncovering its secrets in a nearby monastery and then by traveling through a treacherous forest to confront those behind it.

A hack of BOLT RPG to make it easy to pick up for one-shots, and a one-shot about going to an event with other queer people by literally fighting your fears. Plenty of community copies.

Originally intended to be a joke adventure for the fantasy realism jam, but it ended up being a fairly substantial guide to actually making a small tapestry from scratch. I will let you decide if it's an actual RPG or not. If nothing else it's free and there's nothing like it.

<p class="title"> Published Content - Maps </p>
<p>All maps allow for limited commercial reuse - you may use them in an adventure or similar product, but may not simply repackage and resell them unchanged.</p>

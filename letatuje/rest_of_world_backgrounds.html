<h2 class="title">Rest of the World</h2>

<p>My assumption is that player characters come from elsewhere, thus avoiding the awkwardness of later publishing something that contradicts the lore you came up with at the table. You don't have to, though, and the next actually published product will have some options for players who want to play those who already live in LÃ©tatujÃ©. I'll also leave the areas outside of LÃ©tatujÃ© only described in broad strokes, so that you can make them your own, or fit it into an existing campaign world.  But I also have some example origins.</p>

<p>I also plan to have an alternate character building method where your "race" is a primarily cosmetic attribute, and you'll go through a series of questions about your character's past and build them accordingly.  The options below are meant to swap out for any racial proficiencies you might have. I don't know if it's balanced, this is just a preliminary idea, feedback accepted.</p>

<p>There were empires before on either side of LÃ©tatujÃ©. At least two, maybe more. These empires have fallen, splintered. For some it was a disater; for others it meant freedom; for others it just means they pay their taxes to someone else now. Some empires might remain, but smaller.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">The Cities</h2>

<p>Most cities are city-states, ruling at most the surrounding area. There might be clusters of cities rules by one monarch.</p>

<p>When inventing your own, here are some qustions to ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What opportunities might you find in the city? Why would someone want to move there? Or why would someone be forced to stay?</li>
  <li>Why would someone be driven to leave; to flee; to travel to a more dangerous land?</li>
  <li>What was the city like in the time of empires?</li>
  <li>What ambition is causing the city to grow?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Hix, the City of Gold.</b>Grown rich in a troubled time; full of art and joy and music and jeweled daggers; anything can be bought and sold, especially justice. Before you fled, who paid for you to die?</p>

<p><b>Silan, City of the Deathless Queen.</b> Heir to the emperor via a circuitous lineage. Undying and in denial, goblets of blood make her immortal. A city of forgotten history, of forbidden magic, its inhabitants forbidden to leave or speak the truth of what lies outside. How did you buy your escape?</p>

<p><b>Oth, the Demon City.</b>In ruin and given over to evil things. The brave and desperate live in the ruins, and those too poor to move away. They fight to regain it inch by inch, and the comradeship between mortals is deep and unbreakable. Why did you finally abandon your companions and leave? Was it better for everyone that way?</p>

<p><b>Xa, the City of Too Many Gods.</b>The empire brought conquered gods here and now there is too much god-essence even for priests. Mortals dare not enter the city, and live in a ring around the outside. It is mostly temples and monasteries. What holy quest lead you to leave the city? </p>

<p><b>The Merchant Cities of Har Ila.</b>Small and scattered and growing, they offer walls and laws and safety. They, too, claim to be the heirs of the empire, though they can't necessarily agree which empire. All who do not follow their laws are criminals; ignorance of the law is no excuse, nor is living somewhere else in the world. You left as a merchant, mercenary, or expert for hire; do you want to return?</p>


<p><b>Firan, the City of Heroes.</b>The king is good. The king is noble. The king is righteous. The king singlehandedly saved the city and will singlehandedly lose it. It is small, impossible to defend, and beset by enemies. Did you leave out of despair, or because you could not meet the king's exacting standards of upright behaviour?</p>
